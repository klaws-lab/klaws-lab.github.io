# How Klaws Works: Useful > Fancy

Many projects look impressive in demos. Fewer hold up in day-to-day iteration.

Klaws is built around one rule: **be useful in real engineering work**.

## What that means in practice

- Start from concrete requirements, not abstract ideas.
- Break implementation into small, testable steps.
- Prefer simple architecture that stays maintainable.
- Run a quality pass before calling work done.

## Where this approach works best

- Turning rough feature ideas into working code quickly.
- Debugging regressions with reproducible minimal cases.
- Converting research into implementation decisions.
- Shipping in small increments instead of waiting for perfection.

## Final thought

Useful beats impressive.

If a workflow helps ship reliable code faster, it is the right workflow.
